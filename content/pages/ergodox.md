Summary: My experience building and using an ErgoDox keyboard

# Building and Using an ErgoDox

If you've never had the privilege of typing on a mechanical keyboard, you are really missing out.
There's just something about clickity-clacking away while you're engrossed in whatever it is you're typing.
*What's so special about mechanical keyboards?*, you might ask.
I'm not going to take the time to explain to you why mechanical keyboards are superior to other keyboards because [others have started writing about them](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/why-mechanical-keyboards-arent-just-for-geeks-anymore/) like I'm doing here.

I happen to agree with them.
I like mechanical keyboards.
If you type at a computer often, I would suggest you try out a mechanical keyboard for a couple days if there's any way that you're able.
If you know a friend or coworker who uses one, I doubt they'd refuse to let you try it out.
A mechanical keyboard may seem like an expensive, unnecessary endeavor but I can almost guarantee that your fingers will thank you for making the switch, not to mention they are fun to use with their clickiness and customizability.

Mechanical keyboards can be a double-edged sword.
I am warning you at the same time that I'm encouraging you.
I'm not denying that mechanical keyboards aren't expensive, but some folks -- not unlike myself -- get the taste (figuratively) of a well-made board and then want another.
And another.
And more.
It has quickly become an expensive hobby of mine.
Finding nice boards as well as adorning them with quality key caps.
I guess you could say that I'm starting my collection :)

## What is an ErgoDox?

Once you start combing the internet looking for keyboards, you find some really interesting places that other keyboardies hangout.
And you find some very cool and interesting creations that people have built.
You find some very refined designs made by manufacturers who have made a name for themselves making solid interactive devices.
Then you come across engineers and do-it-yourselfers who have painstakingly crafted something intriguing, different.
This is what I thought when I first came upon the [ErgoDox](http://ergodox.org/).

The ErgoDox is a split design, vertically ortholinear, fully programmable, keyboard.
That's a heck of a mouthful, but please keep reading.
I'll explain.

**Split design** refers to a common design in keyboards where the layout of the keys are split into left and right halves.
This allows for the key arrangement to be placed at angles less ache inducing to a person's wrists.
There are other keyboards that are split like the [TEK Keyboard](https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php) or the [Kinesis Advantage](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/) for instance.

**Ortholinear** describes the keys being in line with one another either vertically, horizontally, or both.
The ErgoDox has vertically ortholinear arranged keys, meaning the keys are lined up in columns as opposed to rows like the standard keyboard.
A standard keyboard that most people are familiar with is horizontally ortholinear.

**Programmable**.
Electronic devices need firmware and/or software.
The ErgoDox, its design, as well as its firmware, are open-source.
This means that they're [freely available to the public](https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware) as well as modifiable by the public.
Others [write their own firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) pulling ideas from others, or starting from scratch.
[Fancy tools](https://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox) have sprung up around benblazek's firmware if you don't feel like compiling the C yourself, which are quite helpful.
I love the open-source community.
If one does feel like digging deeper, programming his or her keyboard, the sky's the limit because it's just software that can be recompiled, then flashed to the USB controller.
The ErgoDox is a tinkerer's delight!

## Parts & Construction

Now, there are a couple ways that one can acquire an ErgoDox.
One way is to source the pieces from the [official parts list](http://ergodox.org/Hardware.aspx).
This is probably your fastest and cheapest option, which also leaves room to tweak and customize if one is inclined.
Another avenue, probably the most popular, is to purchase a [group buy kit](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox) from Massdrop when they pop up roughly every six months or so.
There was an [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ergodox-ez-an-incredible-mechanical-keyboard) a month or two ago for fully assembled ErgoDox boards that added some interesting fold out legs to the original design, but I believe it's since ended.
It's cool to see the design evolve over time.
I purchased a Massdrop kit because I'm lazy and didn't feel like finding all the different parts scattered across various internet webstores.
You'll need a decent soldering iron and some other tools to help you with the job.

The build process was fairly straight forward.
Nothing that someone with basic DIY mechanical skills couldn't handle.
Massdrop provides [detailed instructions](https://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox/assembly.php) that do a great job showing the process along with high-quality pictures.
I took my time during the build which ended up taking me about 10 hours, but based on your skills you can probably do it quicker.
I simply prefer not to rush.
The most difficult parts I found were soldering the surface-mount diodes to the PCB due to their small size, and soldering the USB mini cable ends to the board.
I would recommend getting some wire strippers when you cut the USB cable.
I didn't have the proper tools and I accidentally ruined a cable.
Luckily I had another lying around.

## Configuration

After completing the construction of an ErgoDox and ensuring all its switches are operational, then comes choosing your key layout.
The easiest is to use Massdrop's ErgoDox Configurator to setup your keys and layers.
The ErgoDox firmware operates using a concept of layers on a stack.
There is always a currently selected layer.
Modifier keys can be placed to switch to and from other layers.

How is this useful?
All alphanumerical keys can be set to the bottom layer, or `layer0`.
With a toggle switch to `layer1`, you'd be able to keep the arrow keys righ under your finger at homerow.
This is probably easier to explain with pictures, but I don't feel like cooking anything up right now.
Maybe in an update on this post?

## Usage

Whoa, this thing is split into two halves?
I can only `spacebar` with my right hand?
What the Heck?
`backspace` is under my left thumb?
Argh, I keep making typos on the bottom row!

I know this all sounds pretty weird.
It certainly was for me when I started typing on my ErgoDox.
Maybe it even sounds bad, but don't worry!
It gets much much better after two weeks.
I never timed my typing before switching to the ErgoDox, so I can't confirm whether I type faster or slower than on qwerty but I have to say that I prefer the ErgoDox.
It's noted that I do feel like I can type just as quickly on the ErgoDox.
My wrist pain has dissapeared because the ErgoDox let's me type with my arms, wrists, and hands in more natural resting positions.

## Conclusion

I love typing on my ErgoDox.
It's a joyful experience being able to use something at work every day that I assembled and tested myself.
the ErgoDox certainly is a different beast from the normal keyboard, but I would recommend it to anyone who may be considering or on the fence about it.
It's a fun experience, and you'll learn a few things about electronics and soldering on the way!

Contact me if you have any questions about the ErgoDox.
I might come back and make updates to this article later.
Pictures, diagrams, or more writing.
Until then, type on!
