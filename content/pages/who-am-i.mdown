Hello, my name is Adam

I'm a Software Engineer at [Red Hat](http://redhat.com).
In May 2012, I graduated from [Elon University](http://elon.edu) with degrees in `Computer Science` and `Computer Information Systems`.
Games take up a good portion of my spare time, including video games, vintage video games, board games, card games, as well as tabletop RPGs.
Most of my programming experience started in Java, though Ruby has become my programming language of choice since working at Red Hat.
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Github](http://github.com) are the best source control tools out there, and [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is the only text editor that anybody should ever need.
