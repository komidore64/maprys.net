  I'm Adam!<br />
  I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="http://redhat.com" target="_blank">Red Hat</a>.
  I graduated from Elon University in May 2012 with degrees in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems.
  I enjoy games of all kinds: video games (old and new), card games, board games, as well as tabletop RPGs like Pathfinder.
  I program a lot in my spare time, on little projects here and there, but I haven't had anything make it big yet (fingers crossed).
  Most of my programming experience started in Java, but I've spread out a bit more since starting at Red Hat using Ruby/Rails and Python.
  I'm a total Git fanboy.
  It's the best source-control tool out there!
  My favorite editor is Vim.
  There's nothing else that comes close!
  Oh, and I like beer too.<br />
