  I'm a senior at Elon University in Burlington, NC.
  I am an avid gamer on the PC and Xbox 360 (also occasionally on older systems
  like the Dreamcast, Playstation, and original Xbox) and on non-electronic
  games, such as card games (Magic the Gathering) and board games (Settlers of Catan, Pandemic).
  I've always enjoyed tinkering and playing on computers. This has lead
  to a major in Computing Sciences which I highly enjoy. I'm currently working towards being a
  programmer. This past summer I had the privilege of working at 
  <a href="http://redhat.com" target="_blank">Red Hat</a> in Raleigh, NC
  as a Software Engineering Intern. I worked on the <a href="http://katello.org" target="_blank">Katello</a>
  project and gained experience collaborating with other engineers across the globe. I had a blast at
  Red Hat and hope to continue working with this company in the future after graduation.<br />
